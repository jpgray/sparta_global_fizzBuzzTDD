# sparta_global_fizzBuzzTDD

This is a program that accepts a range of numbers entered by the user, and returns all the numbers in that range. For any given number in the range, if it is divisible by 3, the word will be replaced by "fizz", or "buzz" for those divisible by 5. If divisible by both, it will instead be replaced with "fizzBuzz"

Some rspec testing has been including to test the divisible by method that checks if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
Another test checks that the whole function returns an array of appropriate length with the correct output.
